"""
Brute-force solvers for static pooled testing strategies.

Static = all B pools chosen up front (no adaptation based on results).
Note: static strategies give the SAME utility whether tests are augmented
or classical, because you don't adapt — only negative pools (r=0) matter.

U^s_NO — optimal static non-overlapping (disjoint pools)
U^s_O  — optimal static overlapping (pools may share individuals)
